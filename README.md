👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a data-driven problem solver transitioning into analytics after several years in operations, retail leadership, and financial services. Throughout my career, I relied on data to improve workflows, coach teams, manage KPIs, and drive results — which naturally led me into the world of business intelligence.

Today, I build analytics projects that combine technical skill with real operational understanding. My work focuses on uncovering meaningful insights, improving processes, and creating dashboards that help teams make smart, informed decisions.

I’m actively working on analytics projects in business performance, customer behavior, return-rate trends, and call-center metrics — and I’m open to outsourcing / contract projects where I can support companies with data cleaning, dashboard development, SQL queries, and KPI analysis.
